## 💡 How It Works

This app is essentially a wrapper around the web version of the music service, implemented using Android's **WebView** component.  
It keeps all the features of the website but adds:

- An Android app icon for quick access
- In-app browsing without external browsers
- Optional splash screen for a smoother launch

## 🚀 Why Use This?

Because sometimes you just want to:
- Skip opening Chrome or any browser
- Get straight into your music
- Have an app icon on your home screen for instant play
